      <p class="intro">Hi I’m Lucia, I’m a Junior FullStack Web Developer who recently finished a coding bootcamp at Le Wagon. It has been an
      incredible experience and I can’t wait to kick off my career as a dev in a talented and diverse team.
      Apart from coding, I love reading, Ashtanga yoga and playing with my cat Mia.</p>

      <h2>Decoding my journey</h2>
    <div class="container-fluid">
        <p>Everything started during the first lockdown in Spain: Our company announced that they would be sacking quite a few
      people and I sort of panicked at the prospect of losing my job, but at the same time I saw it as a blessing in disguise:
      to stop the endless and boring loop of the office rat race.</p>

      <p>I immediately started to find something useful and productive to do within the company, something that would justify my
      existence there. And there it was, the revamp of an internal website that was made with a 20 year old CMS so I had to
      learn HTML & CSS. It paid off as soon after, I kept on learning on my own and finally decided to do a Bootcamp course at
      Le Wagon.</p>

      <p>I never thought that coding would end up being my career choice, but it shows that life is full of unexpected surprises.
      Here you will find the last 2 projects lovingly developed during the course.</p>

      resources to improve their transparency and increase gender equality in the workplace.</p>
